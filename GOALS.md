# Goals & Strategic Priorities

## North Star
Get hired at Google as a Product Manager by demonstrating deep AI product thinking through shipped mini-products, structured evals, and authentic public insights — proving I can build, ship, and reason about AI products at Google's bar.

## Active Goals

### Goal 1: Google PM Readiness
- **Why it matters**: Google is the target. Every task, project, and post should move the needle toward a credible candidacy for an L6/L7 PM role on an AI-focused team.
- **Success looks like**: A portfolio of 2-3 shipped AI mini-products with live demos, eval reports, and architecture write-ups that a Google hiring manager would spend more than 30 seconds on.
- **Key results**:
  - [x] Ship 3 demoable AI mini-products with live links *(DONE — shipped 7, with 3 having live demos: Strategic Fit Canvas, Bedtime Story Generator, Slides Pipeline)*
  - [ ] Upgrade top 3 projects to meet Google-bait checklist (evals, agent workflows, telemetry, architecture docs)
  - [ ] Each upgraded project includes: eval report, architecture diagram, 2-min demo video, clean README
  - [ ] Get at least 1 warm referral to a Google PM role
  - [ ] Complete 5+ mock PM interviews using Google-style frameworks (product sense, execution, leadership)

### Goal 2: AI Product Portfolio — "The 3 Bets"
- **Why it matters**: The portfolio is the proof. Not slides — working products that demonstrate product judgment, agentic AI, grounded RAG, evals, and shipping discipline.
- **Success looks like**: Three complementary projects that cover different AI capabilities (grounding/RAG, agentic workflows, multi-source pipelines) and each tell a clear story about PM craft.
- **Key results**:
  - [ ] Bet #1 (Strategic Fit Canvas): V1 live with JD/resume upload, radar chart, fit narrative, eval report
  - [ ] Bet #2 (Investing Fees Assistant): V1 live with citation-backed answers, grounded RAG, eval dashboard
  - [ ] Bet #3 (Narrative Divergence Detector): V1 live with divergence dashboard, evidence view, weekly digest
  - [ ] Each project ships the full "professional bundle" (demo, repo, diagram, eval report, video, LinkedIn post)

### Goal 3: LinkedIn Thought Leadership (No Slop)
- **Why it matters**: LinkedIn is the distribution channel. Authentic posts that share real learnings from building AI products attract the right attention — recruiters, AI PMs, hiring managers.
- **Success looks like**: A consistent posting cadence (2-3x/week) where each post shares a genuine insight from building, not reheated AI hype. Engagement from Google PMs or recruiters on at least 2 posts.
- **Key results**:
  - [ ] Publish 20+ LinkedIn posts sharing real build learnings by Q2 2026 *(8 published so far, ~1,200 followers, best post 3,000 impressions)*
  - [x] Each mini-product generates at least 1 post with: problem, demo GIF, what's novel, link *(DONE for 7 shipped projects)*
  - [ ] Build a voice guide so AI-assisted drafts sound like me, not ChatGPT *(voice samples collected — 8 posts in Knowledge/voice-samples/)*
  - [ ] Get engagement (comments/DMs) from at least 3 Google employees

### Goal 4: Technical AI Fluency (PM Depth, Not Engineer Depth)
- **Why it matters**: Google expects PMs to go deep on AI concepts — not to write models, but to reason about architecture, tradeoffs, and evaluation. The CFA + CS background is a differentiator if paired with modern AI fluency.
- **Success looks like**: Can confidently discuss RAG architectures, agent orchestration, eval frameworks, multimodal pipelines, and responsible AI in an interview setting — with examples from projects I built.
- **Key results**:
  - [ ] Hands-on experience with: RAG (chunking, retrieval, reranking), agentic workflows (multi-step tool use), evals (golden sets, regression tests), and at least one multimodal feature
  - [ ] Write 3+ "what I learned building X" posts that demonstrate technical depth from a PM lens
  - [ ] Complete the CFA Institute Data Science for Investment Professionals certificate

## Themes
- **Ship fast, learn publicly** — Velocity matters more than polish. Ship V1, post what you learned, iterate.
- **Depth over breadth** — 3 excellent projects beat 10 shallow ones. Each project should go deep on a different AI capability.
- **PM craft, not engineering flex** — Every project should demonstrate product judgment (who is this for, why does it matter, how do we measure success) not just technical chops.
- **Grounding + evals = credibility** — Citations, golden test sets, and measurable improvements are what separate serious AI work from toy demos.
- **Financial services as superpower** — The CFA + SocGen background is rare in AI PM candidates. Lean into fintech/investment use cases where others can't.
