## AI Analysis

### Suggested Judgement: **partial**

No clear success or failure signals. Requires manual review.

### Detected Patterns

**Positive:**
- `efficient-tool-use`: Used 3 tool calls with 3 different tools

### Suggested CLAUDE.md Improvements

- Current patterns are working well. No changes needed.

### Suggested Next Steps

- Manually review session to determine actual outcome
- Check if task was completed outside this session
- Update judgement after review

---

## Thinking Analysis

### Thinking Block 1
```
The user wants to run evals. Based on the AGENTS.md file, I have access to eval-related tools:
- `generate_eval` - Create eval from Claude Code session
- `list_evals` - View session evaluations
- `annotate_eval` - Add judgement/notes
- `get_eval_summary` - Stats on evals

Let me first check what evals exist and get a summary of the current state.
```

### Thinking Block 2
```
There are no evals yet. The user wants to "run evals" - this likely means they want to generate an eval from a recent Claude Code session. Let me try to generate one from the most recent session.
```
