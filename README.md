## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanaiproduct/product-os.git
cd product-os
```

### 2. Run Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The setup will:
- Create your workspace directories
- Guide you through questions about your goals and priorities
- Generate your personalized GOALS.md
- Copy template files

**Note:** Python 3.10+ is only needed if you want to run the MCP server. The basic setup works with just bash.

### 3. Start Using It
```
# In your AI assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
"Read AGENTS.md and help me get organized"
```

## How It Works

1. **Brain dump** - Drop notes into `BACKLOG.md` (no structure needed)
2. **Process** - Say "process my backlog" to your AI
3. **Get organized** - AI creates prioritized tasks based on your GOALS.md
4. **Stay focused** - Ask "what should I work on?" for smart suggestions

### Common Commands

- `"Process my backlog"` - Turn notes into tasks
- `"What should I work on?"` - Get AI suggestions
- `"Show me my P0 tasks"` - See urgent items
- `"Mark [task] as done"` - Complete work

### Priorities

| Priority | Meaning | Limit |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P0** | Do today | max 3 |
| **P1** | This week | max 7 |
| **P2** | Scheduled | - |
| **P3** | Someday/maybe | - |

## Daily Workflow

**Morning:** `"Show me today's priorities"` → Pick 1-3 tasks

**During work:** Brain dump into BACKLOG.md, save docs to Knowledge/

**End of day:** `"Mark [task] as done"`

**Weekly:** `"Process my backlog"` + `"Clean up old tasks"`

## Features

- Goal-driven prioritization based on your vision
- Smart deduplication detects duplicate tasks
- Natural language - just talk to your AI
- Session evals to review and learn from AI interactions
- 2-minute setup, no Python required
- MCP integration for Claude and other AI assistants

## For Contributors

The `core/` directory contains the reusable system. Contributions should:
- Not include personal information
